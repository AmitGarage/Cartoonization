1 ) Surface representation - Contains a smooth surface of cartoon images
2 ) Structure representation - It refers to the sparse color-blocks and flatten global content in the celluloid style workflow
3 ) Texture representation - It reflects highfrequency texture, contours, and details in cartoon images
